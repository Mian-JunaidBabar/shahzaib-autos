The main product catalog (Inventory) page for an automotive dealership, allowing users to browse all available cars with filters.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**

- **Theme:** Light mode default, clean, energetic, and professional.
- **Background:** Pure White (#ffffff)
- **Primary Accent:** Energetic Blue (#1773cf) for main call-to-action buttons, prominent links, and active states.
- **Surfaces/Containers:** Subtle Cool Gray (#f1f5f9) for secondary background sections to separate content cleanly without heavy shadows.
- **Text Primary:** Deep Space Black/Slate (#0f172a) for high readability.
- **Roundness:** 8px (rounded-md to rounded-lg) for buttons, cards, and input fields.
- **Typography:** Inter sans-serif font. Bold for headers, regular for details.
- **Shadows:** Very soft, diffused shadows to maintain a relatively flat, modern aesthetic.

**Page Structure:**

1. **Header:** Sticky navigation bar with the company logo on the left, links (Home, Inventory, Services, About, Contact) in the center, and a primary "Book Now" button on the right.
2. **Page Header Banner:** A sleek, dark Slate (#0f172a) banner with the title "Our Inventory", a subtitle, and a breadcrumb navigation.
3. **Filter Sidebar (Left Col):** Search bar, checkboxes for Makes (BMW, Audi, Mercedes), sliders for Price Range, Year, and Mileage, stylized with 8px rounded borders and the primary blue for active states.
4. **Product Grid (Right Col):** A clean 3-column grid of car cards (same style as the featured ones on home: image, make/model, badge, price, specs list, and a "View Details" button). Include pagination at the bottom.
5. **Footer:** Simple footer with quick links, social media icons, and copyright text on a dark background.
