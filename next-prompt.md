A high-impact, professional, and elegant public home page for an automotive accessories dealership. It should look premium and feature subtle, good-looking micro-animations that make the UI feel alive.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**

- **Theme:** Light mode default, exceptionally clean, elegant, and premium.
- **Background:** Pure White (#ffffff) with very subtle off-white sections (#f8fafc) to distinguish areas.
- **Primary Accent:** Elegant Deep Teal (#204a4c) or Energetic Blue (#1773cf) for main call-to-action buttons and interactive states.
- **Surfaces/Containers:** White cards with incredibly soft, diffused, elegant drop shadows (like an Apple or premium Stripe site).
- **Text Primary:** Dark Charcoal/Slate (#0f172a) for high readability.
- **Roundness:** 12px (rounded-xl) for cards and prominent buttons to feel modern and premium.
- **Typography:** Inter sans-serif font. Bold for headers, regular for details.
- **Animations (Implied in styling):** Buttons should have subtle hover scales, cards should have "lift" shadows on hover. Use badges for "New" or "Hot".

**Page Structure:**

1. **Header:** Sticky navigation bar with the company logo on the left, clear dropdown links (Home, Categories, Brands, New Arrivals, Contact) in the center, and a stylized "Book Service" button on the right along with search/cart icons.
2. **Hero Section:** A large, elegant, striking background image or split-layout (text on left, dramatic car accessory on right). Bold headline "Premium Car Accessories & Upgrades", descriptive subheadline, and a primary "Shop New Arrivals" button.
3. **Shop By Top Brands (Category Slider):** A horizontal, clean row of brand logos or small category cards (Toyota, Honda, Suzuki, MG, Changan, Peugeot, Car Care) that looks horizontally scrollable.
4. **New Arrivals:** A clean 4-column grid showing premium accessories (e.g., LED headlights, Carbon exhaust tips). Cards should have high-quality images, product titles, prices, and an "Add to Cart" button that appears on hover.
5. **Entertainment On the Go:** A dedicated section highlighting Android Multimedia LCDs and Subwoofers. Use a slightly different background color (#f8fafc) to make it stand out.
6. **Weekly Best Sellers:** Another product grid featuring the top-selling items like 7D custom mats and dashboard covers. Show "Bestseller" badges on these cards.
7. **Call to Action / Newsletter:** A sleek, dark-themed banner (#0f172a) asking users to subscribe to the newsletter for exclusive discounts on auto parts.
8. **Footer:** Comprehensive but clean footer with quick links, categories (Interior, Exterior, LED/Lightening), contact info, and social icons.
