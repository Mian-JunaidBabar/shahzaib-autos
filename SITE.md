# Site Vision: Shahzaib Autos (AM-Motors Theme)

We are migrating the entire Shahzaib Autos application to the sleek, high-contrast, professional automotive design system defined by "AM-Motors" (Stitch Project ID: `16012330291470935479`). The goal is to modernize the UI and ensure 100% design consistency across all 37 pages of the application.

## 5. Roadmap

Our priority is to migrate the core flow first:

1. Public Home Page
2. Public Products & Contact
3. Admin Login
4. Admin Dashboard Home
5. Admin Inventory Flow

## 6. Creative Freedom

If the roadmap is empty, feel free to design new interactive widgets or statistics panels that might benefit the admin dashboard.
