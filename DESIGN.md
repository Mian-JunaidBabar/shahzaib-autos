# Design System: AM Motors

**Project ID:** 16012330291470935479

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

The AM Motors visual theme is built for a professional automotive showcase. The mood is clean, straightforward, and energetic, focusing on high contrast between pure backgrounds and vibrant primary actions. It prioritizes clarity and immediate user engagement, projecting reliability and a modern digital dealership experience. The interface feels lightweight and snappy, avoiding overly dense information layouts in favor of generous spacing and clear typographic hierarchy.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

- **Energetic Blue** (`#1773cf`): The primary accent color used for main actions, interactive elements, highlights, and primary buttons. It demands attention and drives conversions.
- **Pure White** (`#ffffff`): The primary background color for the Light theme, creating a crisp, distraction-free canvas for automotive imagery and content.
- **Deep Space Black/Slate** (Implied from typical high-contrast Light themes, e.g., `#0f172a`): Used for primary text, ensuring high readability and a strong, grounded feel.
- **Subtle Cool Gray** (Implied, e.g., `#f1f5f9`): Used for secondary backgrounds, subtle container fills, or borders to create structure without visual clutter.

## 3. Typography Rules

- **Font Family:** Inter (`font-sans`).
- **Character:** A highly legible, versatile, and modern sans-serif. It provides a neutral but authoritative voice, suitable for both large promotional headings and dense technical specifications.
- **Usage:** Expect strong, bold weights for section titles and product names to establish clear hierarchy, while regular weights are used for descriptive text and data to ensure maximum clarity.

## 4. Component Stylings

- **Overall Roundness:** `ROUND_EIGHT` (8px / `rounded-md` to `rounded-lg`).
- **Buttons:** Generally pill-shaped or with moderately rounded corners (8px) to feel friendly and clickable. Primary buttons prominently feature the Energetic Blue (`#1773cf`).
- **Cards/Containers:** structured with subtle `8px` rounded corners. They likely use very light, diffused shadows or subtle borders to separate them from the main background, maintaining a relatively flat, clean aesthetic rather than heavy elevation.
- **Inputs/Forms:** Clean, bordered inputs with subtle focus rings utilizing the primary blue.

## 5. Layout Principles

- The layout favors a structured, grid-based approach typical of modern e-commerce and showcase sites.
- Generous whitespace (padding and margins) separates distinct sections (e.g., hero, featured vehicles, services) to prevent cognitive overload.
- Content is likely aligned to a central column with maximum widths to maintain readability on large desktop screens (`Device Type: DESKTOP`).
- Visual hierarchy is strictly maintained through typography sizing and the strategic application of the primary accent color.
